/* What is the DOM?
When a webpage is loaded in the browser, the browser reads the HTML and creates a big tree-like structure in memory. This structure is called the DOM.*/

/*JavaScript can use the DOM to find elements, change their content or style, add new things, or remove them. This lets you update the page without refreshing it. You can also react to user actions like clicks or typing using events. In short, the DOM is the bridge between HTML and JavaScript.*/
